## Reviewer's Guide by Sourcery

This PR bumps the version of upsonic from 0.28.4 to 0.34.3, introducing several new features, bug fixes, and documentation improvements. The changes primarily involve updating the `requirements.txt` file to reflect the new version and removing now-redundant package specifications from `requirements.in`.

<summary>🪧 Tips</summary>

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`
  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the ""Files changed"" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
  -	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`
  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.
- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.
- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.

### Other keywords and placeholders

- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.
- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.
- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.

### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)

- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.
- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.
- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`

### Documentation and Community

- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.
- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.
- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.

<details><summary><strong>✨ CI feedback usage guide:</strong></summary><hr>

The CI feedback tool (`/checks)` automatically triggers when a PR has a failed check.
The tool analyzes the failed checks and provides several feedbacks:
- Failed stage
- Failed test name
- Failure summary
- Relevant error logs

In addition to being automatically triggered, the tool can also be invoked manually by commenting on a PR:
```
/checks ""https://github.com/{repo_name}/actions/runs/{run_number}/job/{job_number}""
```
where `{repo_name}` is the name of the repository, `{run_number}` is the run number of the failed check, and `{job_number}` is the job number of the failed check.

#### Configuration options
- `enable_auto_checks_feedback` - if set to true, the tool will automatically provide feedback when a check is failed. Default is true.
- `excluded_checks_list` - a list of checks to exclude from the feedback, for example: [""check1"", ""check2""]. Default is an empty list.
- `enable_help_text` - if set to true, the tool will provide a help message with the feedback. Default is true.
- `persistent_comment` - if set to true, the tool will overwrite a previous checks comment with the new feedback. Default is true.
- `final_update_message` - if `persistent_comment` is true and updating a previous checks message, the tool will also create a new message: ""Persistent checks updated to latest commit"". Default is true.

See more information about the `checks` tool in the [docs](https://pr-agent-docs.codium.ai/tools/ci_feedback/).
